# IoTDB Connector

Native Irodori Table connector extension for IoTDB.

This crate packages the connector metadata, native ABI exports, and driver implementation used by the Irodori extension marketplace.

## Connector

- Extension ID: `irodori.iotdb`
- Engine ID: `iotdb`
- Wire protocol: `timeSeries`
- Default port: `6667`
- Native ABI: `irodori.connector.native.v1`
- Driver linked: `yes`
- Marketplace visibility: `public`
- Package version: `0.1.7`

The package uses the connector metadata and native driver directly; no desktop adapter source snapshot is required.

Connector metadata lives in `connector.config.json` and `irodori.extension.json`.
The Rust crate exports the native ABI from `src/lib.rs`, uses `irodori-connector-abi` for shared JSON/buffer helpers, and keeps connector behavior in `src/driver.rs`.

## Connection Metadata

- Endpoint modes: `hostPort`, `connectionString`
- Transport modes: `direct`, `sshTunnel`, `socks5Proxy`, `httpConnectProxy`, `proxyChain`
- TLS supported: `yes`
- TLS required by default: `no`
- Custom driver options: `yes`

### Endpoint Fields

| Field | Label | Type | Required |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `host` | Host | `string` | yes |
| `port` | Port | `number` | no |
| `database` | Database | `string` | no |

## Authentication

The connector advertises these authentication modes so clients can render the right credential fields. Driver-specific or provider-specific values can still be passed through `options` when needed.

| Auth method | Label | Kind | Secret purposes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `none` | No authentication | `none` | none |
| `connectionString` | Connection string / DSN | `connectionString` | none |
| `userPassword` | User/password | `userPassword` | `password` |
| `bearerToken` | Bearer token | `token` | `token` |
| `kerberos` | Kerberos / GSSAPI | `kerberos` | `token` |
| `clientCertificate` | Client certificate / mTLS | `certificate` | `privateKey`, `privateKeyPassphrase` |
| `customDriverOptions` | Custom driver options | `custom` | `password`, `token`, `privateKey`, `privateKeyPassphrase` |

## Experience Metadata

- Domains: `timeSeries`
- Result views: `timeChart`, `table`, `heatmap`
- Object types: `storageGroups`, `devices`, `measurements`, `templates`, `ttl`
- Inspired by: Apache IoTDB time-series hierarchy, GROUP BY time, ALIGN BY DEVICE, FILL

| Workflow | Result view | Templates |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Device aligned query | `timeChart` | `time-iotdb-group-by-device` |
| Gap fill | `timeChart` | `time-iotdb-fill` |
| Latest telemetry | `table` | `time-iotdb-latest` |

| Template | Label | Language | Result view |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `time-iotdb-group-by-device` | GROUP BY time aligned by device | `sql` | `timeChart` |
| `time-iotdb-fill` | Fill missing windows | `sql` | `timeChart` |
| `time-iotdb-latest` | Latest values | `sql` | `table` |

## Native ABI Calls

| Method | Response |
| --- | --- |
| `health` | Returns connector health, engine id, ABI version, and driver status. |
| `describe` | Returns the embedded manifest and connector config. |
| `manifest` | Returns raw `irodori.extension.json`. |
| `config` | Returns raw `connector.config.json`. |
| `connect` | Opens and validates a native connector connection. |
| `query` | Runs a connector query and returns structured rows or JSON results. |
| `metadata` | Reads schemas, tables, columns, indexes, collections, or equivalent metadata. |
| `close` | Closes and removes a cached native connection. |

## Development

All extension crates in this checkout share `../target` so dependencies compile once across sibling repositories.

```sh
make check
make build
```

Release packages place platform-specific native artifacts under `dist/native`.

## License

0BSD. You can use, copy, modify, and distribute this project for almost any purpose.

## Apache IoTDB third-party notices

This package includes Apache IoTDB client 0.3.12 (Apache-2.0).
The upstream license and notices are reproduced here so native release archives
retain them together with the binary. Project-authored connector code retains
its own MIT OR 0BSD licensing.

      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the

      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
